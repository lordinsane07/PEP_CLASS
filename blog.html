<h3>Understanding Machine Learning Basics</h3>
<p><i>Published on: 20 January 2026</i></p>

<p>
Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on
building systems capable of learning from data. Instead of being explicitly
programmed, ML models identify patterns and make predictions based on input data.
</p>

<p>
Common types of Machine Learning include supervised learning, unsupervised
learning, and reinforcement learning. Each serves different real-world problems
such as prediction, clustering, and decision-making.

<h3>Why Data Structures Matter in Real Projects</h3>
<p><i>Published on: 15 January 2026</i></p>

<p>
Data Structures form the backbone of efficient software systems. Choosing the
right structure can significantly improve performance, memory usage, and
scalability of applications.
</p>

<p>
For example, arrays are fast for indexing, while trees and graphs are better
for hierarchical or relational data. Understanding these trade-offs is critical
for any serious software engineer.
